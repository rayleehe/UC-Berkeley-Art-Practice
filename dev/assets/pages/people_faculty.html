          <img class='img-1' id='people' src = "../../assets/img/people/faculty/Greg.png">
          <p><b>GREGORY OTTO NIEMEYER</b> Born in Switzerland in 1967, Greg Niemeyer studied Classics and Photography. He started working with new media when he arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1992. He received his MFA from Stanford University 1997. At the same time, he founded the Stanford University Digital Art Center.</p>

           <p>In 2001 he was appointed at UC Berkeley as a Professor for New Media in Art Practice. He co-founded and directed the Center for New Media, focusing on the critical analysis of the impact of new media on human experiences. His current work focuses on mediations between individuals, communities and environments. When do technologies dehumanize us, and when do they help us deepen human experiences?           
          </p>
          <p><b>Why Cal?</b>  Greg Niemeyer loves working at Cal because he finds deep support and plenty of collaborative energy for wildly innovative projects among Cal colleagues, students and staff. </p>

      <h1> KENYATTA A.C. HINKLE </h1>
      <h3> ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PAINTING</h3>
      <img class='img-1' id='people' src = "../../assets/img/people/faculty/kenyatta.png">
      <p><b>KENYATTA A.C. HINKLE</b>is an interdisciplinary visual artist, writer and performer, Hinkle was born in Louisville, KY and has often split her time between multiple geographies simultaneously. Her practice fluctuates between collaborations and participatory projects with alternative gallery spaces within various communities to projects that are intimate and based upon her private experiences in relationship to historical events and contexts. Hinkle utilizes drawing, painting, photography, dance, sculpture and socially engaged projects in order to navigate  “The Historical Present,” a term that has become a mantra for her practice. She strives to examine the residue of history and how it affects our contemporary world perspective in relationship to gender, race, and politics of being. In 2009 Hinkle received her BFA in Painting from The Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA)  Baltimore, MD and in 2012 she received a dual MFA in Art & Critical Studies Creative Writing from The California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) Valencia, CA. In the Fall of 2018 Hinkle became the Assistant Professor of Painting in The Department of Art Practice. </p>

      <p>Her artwork and experimental writing has been exhibited and performed at The Studio Museum in Harlem, Project Row Houses, The California African American Museum, The Hammer Museum, The Museum of Art at The University of New Hampshire, The Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD) in San Francisco, The Made in LA 2012 Biennial and The BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK among others. Hinkle’s work has been reviewed by the Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly, Artforum, Hyperallergic, Ebony Magazine, The Huffington Post, The Washington Post and The New York Times. She is also the recipient of several awards including: The Cultural Center for Innovation’s Investing in Artists Grant, Social Practice in Art (SPart-LA), Jacob K Javits Fellowship for Graduate Study, The Fulbright Fellowship, and The Rema Hort Mann Foundation Emerging Artists Award. Her writing has appeared in Not That But This, Obsidian Journal, Among Margins: Critical & Lyrical Writing on Aesthetics. Hinkle’s limited edition art book Kentifrications: Convergent Truth(s) & Realities 2018 was published by Occidental College in collaboration with Sming Sming Books. She has a forthcoming book titled SIR, a reflection on naming as a tool for undefining the defined, that will be published with Litmus Press.
      </p>

      <p><b>Why Cal?</b>Hinkle loves working at Cal  because of the legacy of social justice that UC Berkeley fosters as well as the access to so many brilliant colleagues, students and staff that know the importance of socio-political expression, research and inquiry.</p>

      <h1> ANNE WALSH </h1>
      <h3> ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR FOR TIME BASED ART</h3>
      <img class='img-1' id='people' src = "../../assets/img/people/faculty/anne.png">
      <p><b>ANNE WALSH</b>is an interdisciplinary artist, writer and performer. She frequently engages collaborators in the retelling of histories and the translating of texts. This process of making, with its risks, desires, and failures, gives unstable shape to her completed work. Walsh’s performances, videos, sculpture and works on paper have been exhibited at Diapason, NYC; San Francisco Camerawork; Rosenbach Museum and Library (Philadelphia); Artists Space (NYC); Royal College of Art (London), Lothringer 13 (Munich), the Whitney Museum of American Art, and as part of the Hayward Gallery's (London) traveling exhibition program. Her sound work with Chris Kubick has aired on multiple National Public Radio (US) programs, Resonance Radio (UK), Munich Public Radio, Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p>

      <p>In Spring 2019, No Place Press releases Walsh’s full-length book, Hello Leonora Soy Anne Walsh, which collects Walsh’s multipart responses to surrealist painter Leonora Carrington's novel The Hearing Trumpet (written in the early 1960s, published in 1974). Over the past decade and using multiple media, Walsh chronicled her time with the nonagenarian author and, ultimately, her assumption of the identity of the aging artist. Hello Leonora, Soy Anne Walsh is a visual and written “adaptation” of Carrington's feminist novella, offering a narrative in fragments: a middle-aged artist named Anne Walsh falls in love with the 92-year-old author of a book about a 92-year-old woman who is placed in a sinister and increasingly surreal retirement home.</p>

      <P>The story is told through facsimiles of hand-written letters, annotated research notes, post-it note flow charts, cast lists, scripts, and a photographic essay that loosely narrates Walsh's visits to Carrington in Mexico City, with additional texts by writer Dodie Bellamy, art historian Julia Bryan-Wilson, and poet and critic Claudia La Rocco.</P>

      <p><b>Why Cal?</b>I was lured to Cal by its libraries, BAM/PFA, and the students and colleagues I knew I would learn to think with. Cal’s support for research across and between radically different ways of knowing makes it the ideal place for artists invested in rigorous thinking and action. </p>

      <h1> STEPHANIE SYJUCO </h1>
      <h3> ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF SCULPTURE</h3>
      <img class='img-1' id='people' src = "../../assets/img/people/faculty/Stephanie.png">
      <p><b>STEPHANIE SYJUCO </b>creates large-scale spectacles of collected cultural objects, cumulative archives, and temporary vending installations, often with an active public component that invites viewers to directly participate as producers or distributors. Using critical wit and collaborative co-creation, her projects leverage open-source systems, shareware logic, and flows of capital, in order to investigate issues of economies and empire. Recent installations and photographic series have explored the construction of ethnographic imagery, media distortion of contemporary public protest, and historical cultural conflicts, via materially-based props and sculptures arranged in large-scale tableaus.</p>

      <p>Born in the Philippines in 1974, Syjuco received her MFA from Stanford University and BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute. She is featured in the acclaimed PBS documentary series Art21: Art in the Twenty-First Century, Season 9, released in September 2018, and is included in the 2018 Renwick Invitational “Disrupting Craft” at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Her awards and residencies include the Guggenheim Fellowship (2014), Artadia Fellowship Residency Award at the International Studio and Curatorial Program (2010), Joan Mitchell Painters & Sculptors Award (2009), and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (1997). She has had major exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art (2018); the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2018, 2017, 2011, 2000); Havana Biennial (2015); Asian Art Biennial (2015); Z33 Space for Contemporary Art (2012); ZKM Center for Art and Media Technology (2011); MoMA P.S.1 (2009, 2006); and Whitney Museum of American Art (2005). Syjuco is a long-time educator and lives and works in Oakland.</p>

      <p><b>Why Cal?</b>I can’t think of a better place that supports a research-based arts practice within a world-class public university. As a site of collected knowledge, UC Berkeley offers its community of artists unprecedented access to libraries, facilities, and research opportunities all across campus. Plus, being at Cal fosters interdisciplinary thinking, and its radical history continues to shape the urgent nature of work being made by students and professors alike. </p>

      <h3> ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT CHAIR</h3>
      <img class='img-1' id='people' src = "../../assets/img/people/faculty/alan.png">
      <p><b>Allan deSouza's </b>cross-media works restage colonial legacies through counter-strategies of humor, fiction, re-inscription, and (mis)translation. As an example, a recent project, Through the Black Country, transposes Henry Stanley’s 1870s East African expedition journals to England during the 2016 Brexit vote. deSouza’s work has been shown extensively in the US and internationally, including at the Krannert Museum, IL; the Phillips Collection, Washington, DC; the International Center for Photography, NY; and the Pompidou Centre, Paris. deSouza’s book, How Art Can Be Thought, (Duke, 2018) examines the vocabulary used to discuss art, and proposes decolonizing artistic and pedagogical practices that can form new attachments within the contemporary world. Most immediately, the book lays some foundations for strategies and goals of MFA programs in Studio Art. deSouza is represented by Talwar Gallery, NY and New Delhi.
</p>

      <p>deSouza received an MFA in Photography from UCLA, a BA(Hons) Fine Art from Bath Academy of Art, England, and participated in the Critical Studies program of the Whitney Independent Studies Program.</p>

      <p><b>Why Cal?</b>The opportunity to work collectively in a department and university that actively prepare students to develop more equitable futures against the active threats of the present.</p>

      <h1> JILL MILLER </h1>
      <h3> ASSISTANT PROFESSOR</h3>
      <img class='img-1' id='people' src = "../../assets/img/people/faculty/jill.jpg">
      <p><b>JILL MILLER </b> is a visual artist who collaborates with individuals and small community groups in the form of public interventions, workshops, installations, and socially engaged art projects. She often creates humorous, non-vital public services that point a finger at something lacking in our culture. For example, The Milk Truck, an emergency breastfeeding advocacy vehicle, was a refurbished ice cream truck with a 5-foot breast on the roof. It called out establishments who were hassling breastfeeding mothers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She intentionally uses humor as a strategy for opening conversations about sensitive subject matter. In past work, she searched for Bigfoot in the Sierra Nevada, inserted herself into the art historical work of John Baldessari, and became a private investigator who performed surveillance on art collectors.</p>

      <p>Born in Illinois, she received her MFA in from University of California, Los Angeles and her BA from University of California, Berkeley in English (high honors). Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally, and collected in public institutions worldwide including CA2M Centro de Arte Dos de Mayo in Madrid and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. She has received numerous grants and awards, including an Individual Engagement Grant from the Wikimedia Foundation and an Arts Council England Award.</p>

      <p><b>Why Cal?</b>In addition to the incredible colleagues and students in Art Practice, Cal was the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement, one of the most important social movements in the history of the US. </p>

      <p><b>Favorite Cal artist: </b>"La Monte Young’s “Composition #5” 1960 is a work of art that I always revisit. He attended Cal briefly but left a big impact."
